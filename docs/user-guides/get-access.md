# Get Access

Currently, there are two ways to use Panoramica. The first
is to set up an instance for yourself or work with a developer to
do that for you. This is ideal if you want full customization and/or
to contribute back to the project.

The second way is to use Panoramica is to use an instance that
Orbit has provisioned. This instance is available to any user of Orbit
and there is no fee. If you're interested in trying out Panoramica and giving
feedback, email [josh@orbit.love](mailto:josh@orbit.love);

## Authentication

Currently, Panoramica supports email authentication via a magic link.
