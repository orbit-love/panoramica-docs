# Get Access

Currently, there are two ways to use Panoramica.

## Set up your own instance

The first is to set up an instance for yourself or work with a developer to
do that for you. This is ideal if you want full customization and/or
to contribute back to the project.

## Use an instance for Orbit users

The second way is to use Panoramica is to use an instance that
Orbit has provisioned. This instance is available to any user of Orbit and there is no fee. If you're interested in trying out Panoramica and giving feedback, drop your
email into the [form on the home page](/#request-access).
